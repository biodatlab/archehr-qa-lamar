        "clinician_question": "Why was ERCP recommended over a medication-based treatment for CBD sludge?",
        "clinical_note": "1: During the ERCP a pancreatic stent was required to facilitate access to the biliary system (removed at the end of the procedure), and a common bile duct stent was placed to allow drainage of the biliary obstruction caused by stones and sludge.\n2: However, due to the patient's elevated INR, no sphincterotomy or stone removal was performed.\n3: Frank pus was noted to be draining from the common bile duct, and post-ERCP it was recommended that the patient remain on IV Zosyn for at least a week.\n4: The Vancomycin was discontinued.\n5: On hospital day 4 (post-procedure day 3) the patient returned to ERCP for re-evaluation of her biliary stent as her LFTs and bilirubin continued an upward trend.\n6: On ERCP the previous biliary stent was noted to be acutely obstructed by biliary sludge and stones.\n7: As the patient's INR was normalized to 1.2, a sphincterotomy was safely performed, with removal of several biliary stones in addition to the common bile duct stent.\n8: At the conclusion of the procedure, retrograde cholangiogram was negative for filling defects.",

        "answer": "Medications can sometimes help in managing bile duct sludge, but in this case, ERCP was necessary due to the severity of the obstruction and its complications.\nThe initial ERCP revealed significant biliary obstruction caused by sludge and stones, requiring the placement of a stent to restore bile drainage |1|.\nHowever, even after this intervention, the liver function tests and bilirubin levels continued to rise, indicating that the obstruction was not fully resolved |5|.\nA follow-up ERCP confirmed that the stent itself had become acutely obstructed by sludge and stones, necessitating further intervention |6|.\nDuring this procedure, a sphincterotomy was performed, and several stones were physically removed, which medications alone could not have achieved |7|.\nThese findings confirm that ERCP was essential in addressing his condition and preventing further complications."

Long surgery / recovery for couple hours then removed packs. why did they do this surgery????? After this time he spent 1 month in hospital now sent home.",

        "clinical_note": "1: He was transferred to the hospital on 2025-1-20 for emergent repair of his ruptured thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm.\n2: He was immediately taken to the operating room where he underwent an emergent salvage repair of ruptured thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm with a 34-mm Dacron tube graft using deep hypothermic circulatory arrest.\n3: Please see operative note for details which included cardiac arrest x2.\n4: Postoperatively he was taken to the intensive care unit for monitoring with an open chest.\n5: He remained intubated and sedated on pressors and inotropes.\n6: On 2025-1-22, he returned to the operating room where he underwent exploration and chest closure.\n7: On 1-25 he returned to the OR for abd closure JP/ drain placement/ feeding jejunostomy placed at that time for nutritional support.\n8: Thoracoabdominal wound healing well with exception of very small open area mid wound that is @1cm around and 1/2cm deep, no surrounding erythema. 9: Packed with dry gauze and covered w/DSD.",
